      "1. Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Component Pascal is Oberon microsystems' refinement of the Oberon-2 language. Oberon microsystems thanks H. M ssenb ck and N. Wirth for the friendly permission to use their Oberon-2 report as basis for this document.\n",
      "Component Pascal is a general-purpose language in the tradition of Pascal, Modula-2, and Oberon. Its most important features are block structure, modularity, separate compilation, static typing with strong type checking (also across module boundaries), type extension with methods, dynamic loading of modules, and garbage collection.\n",
      "Type extension makes Component Pascal an object-oriented language. An object is a variable of an abstract data type consisting of private data (its state) and procedures that operate on this data. Abstract data types are declared as extensible records. Component Pascal covers most terms of object-oriented languages by the established vocabulary of imperative languages in order to minimize the number of notions for similar concepts.\n",
      "Complete type safety and the requirement of a dynamic object model make Component Pascal a component-oriented language.\n",
      "This report is not intended as a programmer's tutorial. It is intentionally kept concise. Its function is to serve as a reference for programmers. What remains unsaid is mostly left so intentionally, either because it can be derived from stated rules of the language, or because it would require to commit the definition when a general commitment appears as unwise.\n",
      "Appendix A defines some terms that are used to express the type checking rules of Component Pascal. Where they appear in the text, they are written in italics to indicate their special meaning (e.g. the same type).\n",
      "It is recommended to minimize the use of procedure types and super calls, since they are considered obsolete. They are retained for the time being, in order to simplify the use of existing Oberon-2 code. Support for these features may be reduced in later product releases.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Syntax\n",
      "\n",
      "An extended Backus-Naur formalism (EBNF) is used to describe the syntax of Component Pascal: Alternatives are separated by |. Brackets [ and ] denote optionality of the enclosed expression, and braces { and } denote its repetition (possibly 0 times). Ordinary parentheses ( and ) are used to group symbols if necessary. Non-terminal symbols start with an upper-case letter (e.g., Statement). Terminal symbols either start with a lower-case letter (e.g., ident), or are written all in upper-case letters (e.g., BEGIN), or are denoted by strings (e.g., \":=\").\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Vocabulary and Representation\n",
      "\n",
      "The representation of (terminal) symbols in terms of characters is defined using the 16-bit Unicode character set, which includes ISO 8859-1 (the Latin‑1 extension of the ASCII character set) as the first 256 characters. Symbols are identifiers, numbers, strings, operators, and delimiters. The following lexical rules must be observed: Blanks and line breaks must not occur within symbols (except in comments, and blanks in strings). They are ignored unless they are essential to separate two consecutive symbols. Capital and lower-case letters are considered as distinct.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Identifiers are sequences of letters, digits, and underscores. The first character must not be a digit.\n",
      "\n",
      "ident = (letter | \"_\") {letter | \"_\" | digit}.\n",
      "letter = \"A\" .. \"Z\" | \"a\" .. \"z\" | UnicodeLetter.\n",
      "digit \t= \"0\" | \"1\" | \"2\" | \"3\" | \"4\" | \"5\" | \"6\" | \"7\" | \"8\" | \"9\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Examples:     x     Scan     Oberon2     GetSymbol     firstLetter\tπ\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Numbers are (unsigned) integer or real constants. The type of an integer constant is INTEGER if the constant value belongs to INTEGER, or LONGINT otherwise (see 6.1). If the constant is specified with the suffix 'H' or 'L', the representation is hexadecimal, otherwise the representation is decimal. The suffix 'H' is used to specify 32-bit constants in the range -2147483648 .. 2147483647. At most 8 significant hex digits are allowed. The suffix 'L' is used to specify 64-bit constants.\n",
      "A real number always contains a decimal point. Optionally it may also contain a decimal scale factor. The letter E means \"times ten to the power of\". A real number is always of type REAL.\n",

      "\n",

      "string  = ' \" ' {char} ' \" ' | \" ' \" {char} \" ' \".\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in single (') or double (\") quote marks. The opening quote must be the same as the closing quote and must not occur within the string. The number of characters in a string is called its length. A string of length 1 can be used wherever a character constant is allowed and vice versa. Characters in string constants are allowed to be Unicode (16 bit) characters.\n",

      "6. Comments may be inserted between any two symbols in a program. They are arbitrary character sequences opened by the bracket (* and closed by *). Comments may be nested. They do not affect the meaning of a program.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Declarations and Scope Rules\n",
      "\n",
      "Every identifier occurring in a program must be introduced by a declaration, unless it is a predeclared identifier. Declarations also specify certain permanent properties of an object, such as whether it is a constant, a type, a variable, or a procedure. The identifier is then used to refer to the associated object. \n",
      "The scope of an object x extends textually from the point of its declaration to the end of the block (module, procedure, or record) to which the declaration belongs and hence to which the object is local. It excludes the scopes of equally named objects which are declared in nested blocks. The scope rules are:\n",
      "1. \tNo identifier may denote more than one object within a given scope (i.e., no identifier may be declared twice in a block);\n",
      "2. \tAn object may only be referenced within its scope;\n",
      "3.\tA declaration of a type T containing references to another type T1 may occur at a point where T1 is still unknown. The  declaration of T1 must follow in the same block to which T is local;\n",
      "4.\tIdentifiers denoting record fields (see 6.3) or methods (see 10.2) are valid in record designators only.\n",
      "\n",
      "An identifier declared in a module block may be followed by an export mark (\" * \" or \" - \") in its declaration to indicate that it is exported. An identifier x exported by a module M may be used in other modules, if they import M (see Ch.11). The identifier is then denoted as M.x in these modules and is called a qualified identifier. Variables and record fields marked with \" - \" in their declaration are read-only (variables and fields) or implement-only (methods) in importing modules.\n",
      "\n",
      "Qualident\t= [ident \".\"] ident.\n",
      "IdentDef\t= ident [\" * \" | \" - \"].\n",

Value parameters are local variables to which the value of the corresponding actual parameter is assigned as an initial value. Variable parameters correspond to actual parameters that are variables, and they stand for these variables. Variable parameters can be used for input only (keyword IN), output only (keyword OUT), or input and output (keyword VAR). IN can only be used for array and record parameters. Inside the procedure, input parameters are read-only. Like local variables, output parameters of pointer types and procedure types are initialized to NIL. Other output parameters must be considered as undefined prior to the first assignment in the procedure. The scope of a formal parameter extends from its declaration to the end of the procedure block in which it is declared. A function procedure without parameters must have an empty parameter list.

However, if a method M' (with the same name as M) is declared to be bound to T1, this overrides the binding of M to T1. M' is considered a redefinition of M for T1. The formal parameters of M and M' must match, except if M is a function returning a pointer type. In the latter case, the function result type of M' must be an extension of the function result type of M (covariance) (see App. A). If M and T1 are exported (see Chapter 4) M' must be exported too.\n",

      "Abstract and empty method declarations consist of a procedure header only. Abstract methods are never called. A record containing abstract methods must be abstract. A method redefined by an abstract method must be abstract. An abstract method of an exported record must be exported. Calling an empty method has no effect. Empty methods may not return function results and may not have OUT parameters. A record containing new empty methods must be extensible or abstract. A method redefined by an empty method must be empty or abstract. Abstract or empty methods are usually redefined (implemented) in a record extension. They may not be called via super calls. A concrete (nonabstract) record extending an abstract record must implement all abstract methods bound to the base record.\n",
      "Concrete methods (which contain a procedure body) are either extensible or final (no attribute). A final method cannot be redefined in a record extension. A record containing extensible methods must be extensible or abstract.\n",
      "If v is a designator and M is a method, then v.M denotes that method M which is bound to the dynamic type of v. Note, that this may be a different method than the one bound to the static type of v. v is passed to M's receiver according to the parameter passing rules specified in Chapter 10.1.\n",

The formal parameter lists of both declarations must match (App. A) and the names of corresponding parameters must be equal.\n",

Identifiers that are to be exported (i.e., that are to be visible in client modules) must be marked by an export mark in their declaration (see Chapter 4).\n",
      "The statement sequence following the symbol BEGIN is executed when the module is added to a system (loaded), which is done after the imported modules have been loaded.

      "2) There is no DISPOSE procedure. Memory cannot be deallocated manually, since this would introduce the safety problem of memory leaks and of dangling pointers, i.e., premature deallocation. Except for those embedded systems where no dynamic memory is used, or where it can be allocated once and never needs to be released, an automatic garbage collector is required.\n",
      "3) Modules and at least their exported procedures (commands) and exported types must be retrievable dynamically. If necessary, this may cause modules to be loaded. The programming interface used to load modules or to access the mentioned meta information is not defined by the language, but the language compiler needs to preserve this information when generating code.\n",
      "Except for fully linked applications where no modules will ever be added at run-time, a linking loader for modules is required. Embedded systems are important examples of applications that can be fully linked.\n",

       "Component Pascal is Oberon microsystems' refinement of the Oberon-2 language. Oberon microsystems thanks H. M ssenb ck and N. Wirth for the friendly permission to use their Oberon-2 report as basis for this document.\n",
       "Component Pascal is a general-purpose language in the tradition of Pascal, Modula-2, and Oberon. Its most important features are block structure, modularity, separate compilation, static typing with strong type checking (also across module boundaries), type extension with methods, dynamic loading of modules, and garbage collection.\n",
       "Type extension makes Component Pascal an object-oriented language. An object is a variable of an abstract data type consisting of private data (its state) and procedures that operate on this data. Abstract data types are declared as extensible records. Component Pascal covers most terms of object-oriented languages by the established vocabulary of imperative languages in order to minimize the number of notions for similar concepts.\n",
       "Complete type safety and the requirement of a dynamic object model make Component Pascal a component-oriented language.\n",

       "\n",
       "An extended Backus-Naur formalism (EBNF) is used to describe the syntax of Component Pascal: Alternatives are separated by |. Brackets [ and ] denote optionality of the enclosed expression, and braces { and } denote its repetition (possibly 0 times). Ordinary parentheses ( and ) are used to group symbols if necessary. Non-terminal symbols start with an upper-case letter (e.g., Statement). Terminal symbols either start with a lower-case letter (e.g., ident), or are written all in upper-case letters (e.g., BEGIN), or are denoted by strings (e.g., \":=\").\n",

Symbols are identifiers, numbers, strings, operators, and delimiters. The following lexical rules must be observed: Blanks and line breaks must not occur within symbols (except in comments, and blanks in strings). They are ignored unless they are essential to separate two consecutive symbols. Capital and lower-case letters are considered as distinct.\n",

The suffix 'H' is used to specify 32-bit constants in the range -2147483648 .. 2147483647. At most 8 significant hex digits are allowed. The suffix 'L' is used to specify 64-bit constants.\n",

       "A procedure declaration consists of a procedure heading and a procedure body. The heading specifies the procedure identifier and the formal parameters. For methods it also specifies the receiver parameter and the attributes (see 10.2). The body contains declarations and statements. The procedure identifier is repeated at the end of the procedure declaration.\n",
       "There are two kinds of procedures: proper procedures and function procedures. The latter are activated by a function designator as a constituent of an expression and yield a result that is an operand of the expression. Proper procedures are activated by a procedure call. A procedure is a function procedure if its formal parameters specify a result type. The body of a function procedure must contain a return statement which defines its result.\n",
       "All constants, variables, types, and procedures declared within a procedure body are local to the procedure. Since procedures may be declared as local objects too, procedure declarations may be nested. The call of a procedure within its declaration implies recursive activation.\n",
       "Local variables whose types are pointer types or procedure types are initialized to NIL before the body of the procedure is executed.\n",

       "Formal parameters are identifiers declared in the formal parameter list of a procedure. They correspond to actual parameters specified in the procedure call. The correspondence between formal and actual parameters is established when the procedure is called. There are two kinds of parameters, value and variable parameters, the latter indicated in the formal parameter list by the presence of one of the keywords VAR, IN, or OUT. Value parameters are local variables to which the value of the corresponding actual parameter is assigned as an initial value. Variable parameters correspond to actual parameters that are variables, and they stand for these variables. Variable parameters can be used for input only (keyword IN), output only (keyword OUT), or input and output (keyword VAR). IN can only be used for array and record parameters. Inside the procedure, input parameters are read-only. Like local variables, output parameters of pointer types and procedure types are initialized to NIL. Other output parameters must be considered as undefined prior to the first assignment in the procedure. The scope of a formal parameter extends from its declaration to the end of the procedure block in which it is declared. A function procedure without parameters must have an empty parameter list. It must be called by a function designator whose actual parameter list is empty too. The result type of a procedure can be neither a record nor an array.\n",

The binding is expressed by the type of the receiver in the heading of a procedure declaration.

       "If a method M is bound to a type T0, it is implicitly also bound to any type T1 which is an extension of T0. However, if a method M' (with the same name as M) is declared to be bound to T1, this overrides the binding of M to T1. M' is considered a redefinition of M for T1. The formal parameters of M and M' must match, except if M is a function returning a pointer type. In the latter case, the function result type of M' must be an extension of the function result type of M (covariance) (see App. A). If M and T1 are exported (see Chapter 4) M' must be exported too.\n",

       "NEW must be used on all newly introduced methods and must not be used on redefining methods. The attribute helps to detect inconsistencies between a record and its extension when one of the two is changed without updating the other.\n",
       "Abstract and empty method declarations consist of a procedure header only. Abstract methods are never called. A record containing abstract methods must be abstract. A method redefined by an abstract method must be abstract. An abstract method of an exported record must be exported. Calling an empty method has no effect. Empty methods may not return function results and may not have OUT parameters. A record containing new empty methods must be extensible or abstract. A method redefined by an empty method must be empty or abstract. Abstract or empty methods are usually redefined (implemented) in a record extension. They may not be called via super calls. A concrete (nonabstract) record extending an abstract record must implement all abstract methods bound to the base record.\n",
       "Concrete methods (which contain a procedure body) are either extensible or final (no attribute). A final method cannot be redefined in a record extension. A record containing extensible methods must be extensible or abstract.\n",
       "If v is a designator and M is a method, then v.M denotes that method M which is bound to the dynamic type of v. Note, that this may be a different method than the one bound to the static type of v. v is passed to M's receiver according to the parameter passing rules specified in Chapter 10.1.\n",
       "If r is a receiver parameter declared with type T, r.M^ denotes the method M bound to the base type of T (super call). In a forward declaration of a method the receiver parameter must be of the same type as in the actual method declaration. The formal parameter lists of both declarations must match (App. A) and the names of corresponding parameters must be equal.\n",
       "Methods marked with \" - \" are \"implement-only\" exported. Such a method can be redefined in any importing module but can only be called within the module containing the method declaration. (Currently, the compiler also allows super calls to implement-only methods outside of their defining module. This is a temporary feature to make migration easier.)\n",

       "2) There is no DISPOSE procedure. Memory cannot be deallocated manually, since this would introduce the safety problem of memory leaks and of dangling pointers, i.e., premature deallocation. Except for those embedded systems where no dynamic memory is used, or where it can be allocated once and never needs to be released, an automatic garbage collector is required.\n",
       "3) Modules and at least their exported procedures (commands) and exported types must be retrievable dynamically. If necessary, this may cause modules to be loaded. The programming interface used to load modules or to access the mentioned meta information is not defined by the language, but the language compiler needs to preserve this information when generating code.\n",
       "Except for fully linked applications where no modules will ever be added at run-time, a linking loader for modules is required. Embedded systems are important examples of applications that can be fully linked.\n",
       "4) The environment must provide the ability to display Unicode characters, except for \"headless\" embedded applications that need no display.\n",
